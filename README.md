Fideligard allows clients to test the historical performance of stock portfolios. Buy and sell stocks based on past performance and Fidelagard will keep track of your transactions and portfolio at any given date. Fideligard is an Angular JS Javascript single-page web application using services, direcrives, ui-router and multi-view states. Historical data comes from Yahoo Finance.

Fideligard also includes a stock-trading game. Start on day 1 and make trades one day at a time. The goal is to have the best-performing portfolio at the end of the simulation.
