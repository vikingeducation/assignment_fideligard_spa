## FIDELIGARD STOCK SIMULATOR

[LIVE DEMO](fideli-stock.surge.sh)

Fideligard is a Stock Portfolio Simulator built using Angular 1.x. It's a

single-page application (SPA) that shuffles and views without having to

refresh the page.

Fideligard utilizes nearly the full extent of Angular's functionality.

Knowledge of state is kept by the services; controllers are made for

each action to stream that state to the view; the router takes care of

managing the different views; and finally, directives are used to keep

the templates clean and readable.
